Type the word you see to destroy the enemy, that's how to play this game. I'm Doanh, the person who will guide you how 
to play in this special level. In addition to entering words on the keyboard, you can hold down the_Alt key and move 
with the keys W_A_S_D to move the character. Each time you release the Alt key, you return to word input mode, which you
can also customize control keys in the settings section by pressing the_Esc key. The words you type are also displayed in
the status bar The bottom state includes parameters such as: typing speed (wpm), score, health and assets (coin).
Especially the search bar acts as an inventory, helping you deploy different skills, you can just open it by pressing 
the key combination Win+S if the bag is not empty. Get items that drop when enemies are destroyed or Using coins 
to buy items is a way to unlock the inventory. When the inventory opens, the entire game space will slow down and the 
word input mode will slow down. Only available with search bar. Try it out by defeating HELLO_WORLD, getting the item,
and Win+S_(press_Enter_to_select_and_Esc_to_close). If you have any problems, you can read the instructions in the 
Settings section again The character will now glow after selecting an item, stopping moving and pressing Enter to cast
the skill. In each level will be a wave of enemies like you experienced, there will be times when small bosses appear 
in the form of a sentence instead of word and final boss as a paragraph! So if you die, the game-ending blue screen 
appears and you cannot play the game this again. So be careful Fix_Your_PC.
